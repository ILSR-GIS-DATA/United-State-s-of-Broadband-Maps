Our search for state-wide broadband maps involved a Google search for "state-name + broadband" or "state-name + broadband map." We considered maps "up-to-date" if they included FCC 477 or other data sources that were dated 2020 or later. Then, each state map was evaluated in terms of the types of data displayed. We categorized and displayed the most precise data used in each state map and displayed four data categories in our final map that include: 
1. Broadband Serviceable Locations (BSLs) 
2. household speed test data 
3. privately shared ISP service areas 
4. FCC 477
5. No up-to-date map available - included states that have no publicly shared map or have no map with current data (i.e., 2020 or later). 

It is important to note that many states include a combination of these data sources in their maps, however, we only sought to highlight the most precise data source that was included in the map.
