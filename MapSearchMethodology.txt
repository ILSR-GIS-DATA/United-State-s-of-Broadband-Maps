Map Search Methodology

Our search for state-wide broadband maps involved a Google search for “state-name + broadband” or “state-name + broadband map.” We considered maps
“up-to-date” if they included FCC 477 or other data sources that were dated 2020 or later. Then, each state map was evaluated in terms of the types of
data displayed. We categorized and displayed the most precise data used in each state map and displayed four data categories in our final map that
include: serviceable locations, household speed test data, privately shared ISP service areas, and FCC 477. An additional fifth category, “no up to
date map available”, included states that have no publicly shared map or have no map with current data (i.e., 2020 or later).
